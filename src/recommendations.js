## üîã Electricity (Score: ${electricityScore})

Your electricity score is **above average**, meaning you have room for improvement to reduce your carbon footprint. Here are some recommendations:

* **Switch to a renewable energy provider.** Many utilities offer plans powered by **solar, wind, or hydro**. This directly reduces your reliance on fossil fuels.
* **Upgrade your appliances.** Older appliances use **more energy** than modern, energy-efficient models. Look for **Energy Star** labels when replacing your refrigerator, washer, dryer, or other appliances.
* **Reduce your energy consumption.** Turn off lights when leaving a room, unplug unused electronics, and use **energy-saving bulbs**.
* **Use smart power strips.** These turn off electronics when not in use, preventing **phantom energy consumption**.
