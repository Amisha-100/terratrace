## üîã Electricity (Score: ${electricityScore})

Your electricity score is **above average**, meaning you have room for improvement to reduce your carbon footprint. Here are some recommendations:

* **Switch to a renewable energy provider.** Many utilities offer plans powered by **solar, wind, or hydro**. Consider [installing solar panels](${AFFILIATE_LINKS.energy.solarCity}) to directly reduce your reliance on fossil fuels.
* **Upgrade your appliances.** Older appliances use **more energy** than modern, energy-efficient models. Start with a [smart thermostat](${AFFILIATE_LINKS.energy.nestThermostat}) for efficient temperature control.
* **Reduce your energy consumption.** Turn off lights when leaving a room, unplug unused electronics, and use [energy-saving smart bulbs](${AFFILIATE_LINKS.energy.ledBulbs}).
* **Use smart power strips.** These turn off electronics when not in use, preventing **phantom energy consumption**.

${vehiclePrompt}

## ‚úàÔ∏è Flight (Score: ${flightScore})

Your flight score indicates room for improvement. Here are some eco-friendly alternatives:

* **Consider train travel** for shorter trips. [Book train tickets](${AFFILIATE_LINKS.flight.trainBooking}) for a scenic, low-carbon journey.
* **Offset your flights.** Support verified [carbon offset projects](${AFFILIATE_LINKS.flight.offsetPrograms}) to compensate for your air travel.
* **Choose alternative transport.** [Long-distance buses](${AFFILIATE_LINKS.flight.busBooking}) are an eco-friendly option for many routes.`;
